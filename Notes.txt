Circuit Breaker
with circuit breaker by firing 100s of request per sec the requests
 will served for few times and then after some time the circuit breker
  will not execut the api and will directly return the response from fallback
watch -n 0.1 curl http://localhost:8000/sample-api

so how to know if a microservice is again up? so that we can continue to call api
isntead of returning the fallback response without even calling the api
read more about states of a circuit breaker
watch -n 0.1 curl http://localhost:8000/sample-api //call multiple times
